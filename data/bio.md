My name is Zunaib Imtiaz and I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 2 plus years of expertise currently working at Afiniti on diversified projects and technologies. I have a background in user interface development, prototype designing, working on complex interface systems and modular application servers for a wide range of experiences as well as the tooling needed to help achieve that goal.

I'm always interested in hearing about any new developer role. I'm fluent in JavaScript, proficient in TypeScript and the JS/TS web stack (Node, Express, ReactJS/Redux, NextJS).
